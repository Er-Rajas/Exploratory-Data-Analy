# Dataset Cleaning and Preprocessing Guide

This guide explains the steps taken to clean and preprocess the COVID-19 dataset before conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) or plotting visualizations.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information on COVID-19 patients with various attributes such as demographics, comorbidities, and medical outcomes. Before analyzing the data, it is crucial to clean and preprocess it to ensure meaningful and accurate results.

## Steps for Cleaning the Dataset

### 1. Handle Missing or Unknown Values
Some columns in the dataset contain placeholder values (e.g., `97`, `98`, `99`) to represent missing or unknown data. These were replaced with `NaN` for better handling during analysis.

```python
import numpy as np

columns_to_clean = [
    'INTUBED', 'ICU', 'PREGNANT', 'DIABETES', 'COPD', 'ASTHMA',
    'INMSUPR', 'HIPERTENSION', 'OTHER_DISEASE', 'CARDIOVASCULAR',
    'OBESITY', 'RENAL_CHRONIC', 'TOBACCO'
]
for col in columns_to_clean:
    df[col] = df[col].replace([97, 98, 99], np.nan)
```

### 2. Convert Data Types
#### Date Conversion
- The `DATE_DIED` column was converted to the `datetime` format.
- A new column, `DIED`, was added to indicate whether a patient died (True/False).

```python
df['DATE_DIED'] = pd.to_datetime(df['DATE_DIED'], errors='coerce', format='%d/%m/%Y')
df['DIED'] = ~df['DATE_DIED'].isna()  # True if a valid date, False otherwise
```

### 3. Remove Duplicate Rows
Duplicate rows in the dataset were removed to prevent skewed results during analysis.

```python
df = df.drop_duplicates()
```

### 4. Handle Remaining Missing Values
Rows with `NaN` values were dropped to ensure a complete dataset. Alternatively, missing values could be imputed with statistical measures such as mean or median.

```python
df = df.dropna()  # Drop rows with NaN
```

### 5. Verify the Dataset
After cleaning, the dataset's structure and summary statistics were verified to ensure correctness.

```python
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
With the cleaned dataset, visualizations and statistical analyses can be performed to identify trends and insights.

- **Bar Plots:** Analyze distributions (e.g., survival vs. death, ICU admission).
- **Heatmaps:** Identify correlations between numeric variables.
- **KDE Plots:** Compare distributions across patient groups.

### 2. Imputation of Missing Values (Optional)
If dropping rows with `NaN` significantly reduces the dataset size, consider imputing missing values based on domain knowledge.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Create new features based on existing columns to enhance predictive modeling.

## Requirements
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Ensure all dependencies are installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## Notes
- Placeholder values (`97`, `98`, `99`) were considered invalid based on the dataset documentation.
- Ensure to validate assumptions against the dataset's metadata or documentation for better preprocessing strategies.
